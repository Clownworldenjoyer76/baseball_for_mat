    # or if your 'games' file lists different game types for the same teams),
    # the merge might create duplicate rows in batters_home/away if there are multiple matches
    # in the 'games_for_merge' DataFrame.
    # You might need to add a .drop_duplicates() on relevant columns or refine your merge key
    # if this is not the desired behavior.
    # For a typical "today's games" file, each team should only have one home/away game.
