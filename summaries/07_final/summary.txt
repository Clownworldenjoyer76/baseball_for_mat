/home/runner/work/baseball_for_mat/baseball_for_mat/scripts/project_game_scores.py:125: FutureWarning: DataFrameGroupBy.apply operated on the grouping columns. This behavior is deprecated, and in a future version of pandas the grouping columns will be excluded from the operation. Either pass `include_groups=False` to exclude the groupings or explicitly select the grouping columns after groupby to silence this warning.

LOAD: daily and season inputs
